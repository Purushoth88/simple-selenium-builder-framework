<a name="simple-selenium-builder-framework" class="anchor" href="#simple-selenium-builder-framework"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>simple-selenium-builder-framework</h1>

<p>Selenium test framework designed to run 'Selenium Builder' recorded tests on 'SauceLabs' using 'TestNG' as a threaded test runner.   Get up and running on SauceLabs in just over 10 minutes (see instructions below).</p>

<h2>
<a name="use-cases" class="anchor" href="#use-cases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use cases</h2>

<ol>
<li> If you need to monitor 100 different websites and just check for one simple thing on each one, then just record 100 Selenium builder recordings, each in a separate test class, export them to Java/TestNG format, and then drop them into this framework.</li>
<li> If you have a website with 3 text fields on it and you want to test all combinations of entering data into those fields without using unit test parameterization, then just create 6 Selenium Builder recordings that represent those combinations, put them each in a separate test class, and drop them into this framework.</li>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>One Test Per Class</th>
    <td>This framework works with one test per class.  It could be enhanced to support multiple <a href="https://github.com/Test" class="user-mention">@Test</a> annotated methods per class but that would require a different TestBase class to support that.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Builder Design Pattern</th>
    <td>This framework uses the 'Builder' design pattern to generate browser instances.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>SauceLabs Driver</th>
    <td>Will run on a free SauceLabs account with a max of 2 threads.  This demo is not designed to run local Selenium browsers but can be adjusted to do so.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>SauceLabs REST API</th>
    <td>Pushes test results to SauceLabs to mark test as passed or failed.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Report Logging</th>
    <td>Logs output to the TestNG HTML report as well as to a Log4j log file.  Logs the thread id during tests so that you know which thread the Selenium messages are coming from.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>TestNG</th>
    <td>Uses TestNG as a multi-threaded test runner and configuration handler.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>No DataProvider</th>
    <td>This framework does not use a DataProvider but if you wanted to generate browser instances from a DataProvider method, this framework could be adjusted to do so.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Command Line Support</th>
    <td>You can run these tests without Eclipse, from the command line, by using the command <b>mvn.bat clean compile test-compile test</b>.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Selenium Builder</th>
    <td>This framework is designed for use with <a href="http://sebuilder.github.io/se-builder/">Selenium Builder</a> in mind.  Using it as a general Selenium framework would take code refactoring.</td>
  </tr>

<a name="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions</h2>

<p>This project will run within Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or from the command line using Maven.</p>

<ol>
<li> Get a free <a href="https://saucelabs.com/">SauceLabs</a> account.</li>
<li> Install the <a href="http://sebuilder.github.io/se-builder/">Selenium Builder</a> firefox plugin.</li>
<li> Import this GitHub archive into Eclipse as a "Maven project".  Download the .zip of this repo to your hard drive and unzip it.  I use Eclipse Luna 4.4 with Java 1.8 but you can also use the older Eclipse with Java 1.7.</li>
<li> Create as many 'Selenium Builder' scripts as you want and place them in the "src/test/java/qa/se/builder" folder,
  just like what is provided in the example.</li>
<li> If you want to run outside of Eclipse from the command line, make sure that the Maven 3.x bin directory is included in your system PATH.</li>
<li> Run-As <code>mvn.bat clean compile test-compile test</code>, otherwise known as the goal <code>test</code> executed by Maven.</li>
<li> View the HTML test result report in the target/surefire-reports folder that is generated at runtime.</li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="using-jenkins" class="anchor" href="#using-jenkins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using jenkins</h2>

<p>This framework is designed to run multi-threaded tests against SauceLabs using Maven.  Jenkins can execute Maven builds and so this framework is perfect for use with Jenkins as a job/test scheduler.</p>
